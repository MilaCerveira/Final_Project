--- Brief

Travelingo is a language learning app with a European road trip theme. The client is written in React, and the server is a Spring application which uses the H2 database driver.

Instead of learning one or two languages well, users can learn the basic words and phrases which would be most needed for very brief stays in a large number of countries.

The current version of this app has questions in Portuguese, Spanish, French, Hungarian and Russian. For now, there are only placeholder questions in Italian, German and Romanian.

---Running Travelingo

To run the client, open the 'client' folder and enter the command 'npm i' in the terminal in order to install the node modules. After this, use the command 'npm start'. The server needs to be running (localhost:8080 by default) for the client to be able to fetch the questions.
